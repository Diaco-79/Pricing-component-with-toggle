# Pricing component with toggle
 A responsive Landing page with CSS/HTML/JS 



Hello there :))

In this project the main goal ( for me atleast) was to make this page responsive with as few lines as possible

Design is from frontendmentor.ir

It's a practice project to tickle my css skills a little bit.

hope you have a great day ;)!

thanks for your time
Diaco.
